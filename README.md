##### Purpose and Scope

The CFPB has made a strategic decision and investments in Salesforce,
an enterprise platform for developing business solutions.
The cost and associated risks of this investment,
coupled with T&I’s obligations to business units to support, deliver, and maintain mission-critical solutions,
require that effective and efficient governance be put in place.

This documentation establishes the standards, controls, and guidance
that enforce technical quality of the platform and product work that goes into CFPB’s Salesforce Organization.
It also describes the primary interfaces between the Enterprise Platforms Team (aka the CoE - Center of Excellence)
and the various Product Teams doing application development on Salesforce.

##### Goals

1. Assure only high quality software is built and deployed to CFPB’s Salesforce platforms
1. Maintain confidence in the deployment process and a high degree of availability for the CFPB salesforce org
1. Establish efficient developer workflows and share knowledge and practices across product development teams
1. Minimize operational burden for the Salesforce Platform Admin Team and the CFPB at large
